  monitor, and alert on log data and events from Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services.

  ## Batching Writes

  High throughput applications should avoid awaiting calls to the logger:

  ```js
  await log.write(logEntry1);
  await log.write(logEntry2);
  ```

  Rather, applications should use a _fire and forget_ approach:

  ```js
  log.write(logEntry1);
  log.write(logEntry2);
  ```

  The `@google-cloud/logging` library will handle batching and dispatching
  these log lines to the API.
